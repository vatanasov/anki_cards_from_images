## About

App for generating [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards from a directory of img files.

## Usage

For a single flashcard, the question img file must end in `q.jpg` and the answer img file must end in `a.jpg`.

For example:

```
questions
├── 1_a.jpg
├── 1_q.jpg
├── 2_a.jpg
└── 2_q.jpg
```

After the output is generated, it must be imported in Anki. The images should be copied to the Anki media folder (for more
information consult the anki documentation).
